# Projet-Polygones-Python
Algorithmic project about polygon inclusions, ENSIMAG first year project.
In this file, you can find 2 scripts in order to solve the 2 following problems: 

We take many polygons on a plan, for each polygon P, we have to determine in which polygons P is included. The first algorithm detects every polygons in which P is included then it sorts them in order to keep the smallest polygon.

The second algorithm is based on the same strategy but instead of looking at every polygons, it just looks at the polygons with an area higher than P. This second version is faster than the previous one.
